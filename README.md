#Budgy!!
The web-app Budgy's purpose is to serve as a micro-blogging site for users.
The name Budgy comes from a small parrot like bird. 
Textual posts on Budgy are called 'sing'. Since birds chirp, tweet and sing.
Users are required to register and login on the web-app to use it and see other individuals profile.
The app  is hosted on PythonAnywhere at http://crystalsedge.pythonanywhere.com/  If you see this README.md in the month of June 2023. There is a possibility
that PyhtonAnywhere has taken down the web-app. 
If I make major changes in the development I will try my best to keep it hosted or will migrate to another service.

Budgy is easy to use and offers a minimalistic apporach in UX. 

Budgy is based on Django Framework.
